# implicit_references
This app converts scientific papers in their PDF formats and extracts references using anystyle.io.
Two documents are chosen and their respective lists of citations are extracted.
These references are then put in alogrithms that determine patterns between the two lists.

Requirements include Flask-bootstrap for Python2.7
